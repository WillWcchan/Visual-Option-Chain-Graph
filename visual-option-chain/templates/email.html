  <p class="text-light"> 
    Thank you for checking this page out! My name is William Chan and I'm a Software Developer @ IBM. 
    I've created this page because I have a passion for learning about options trading.
    While at the same time, I wanted to explore a new language and new tools development tools out there
    for the first time - Python, Django, Redis, Postgresql, etc...
    It was difficult starting and getting things to work, but I managed to get it done with perserverance, reading technical documentations,
    and seeking other places for help.

    If you have any questions/comment, send a message down below.
